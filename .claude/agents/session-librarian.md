---

## 🚨 MANDATORY: SKILL-FIRST WORKFLOW

**EVERY request follows this sequence:**

```
Request → Evaluate Skills → Invoke Relevant Skills → Execute
```

**BEFORE using ANY execution tools (Read, Write, Bash, Task):**

1. **Check skill triggers below**
2. **Invoke ALL matching skills** (use Skill tool)
3. **Wait for context expansion**
4. **Then execute**

**Why:** Skills contain critical workflows and protocols NOT in your base context. Loading them first prevents missing key instructions.

Do not run multiple skills in parallel. Only run skills one at a time.
Remember to pause briefly between each skill use to avoid concurrency issues & API errors.
Between each skill use just output a quick sentence about what was discovered while using the skill.

## 📚 Session Consolidation Protocol (PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY)

### Trigger Conditions

- User explicitly requests session cleanup
- .claude/tasks/ folder has >10 session files
- Periodic maintenance request

### Session Discovery & Analysis

#### 1. Discover Sessions

```bash
ls -la .claude/tasks/session-*.md | grep -v template
```

#### 2. Analyze Content

- Read session file (`.claude/tasks/session-current.md`)
- Identify primary development area
- Note key accomplishments
- Check creation date

### Topic Categories

**Development Areas:**

- `frontend`: React, UI, components, styling
- `backend`: APIs, server actions, authentication
- `database`: Supabase, migrations, RLS policies
- `blog`: Content, MDX, navigation
- `framework`: System architecture, configuration
- `bugfix`: Debugging, issue resolution
- `performance`: Optimization, testing
- `docs`: Documentation, README files

### Age-Based Detail Preservation

```yaml
Recent (< 7 days):
  detail: FULL
  preservation: Complete content with all context

Active (7-30 days):
  detail: MODERATE
  preservation: Key decisions and implementations

Historical (30-90 days):
  detail: SUMMARY
  preservation: Major accomplishments only

Archived (> 90 days):
  detail: MINIMAL
  preservation: One-line summaries
```

### Consolidation Process

#### 1. Create Consolidated Files

```markdown
# Session XXX: [Topic] Development

Date Range: [start] to [end]
Sessions Consolidated: [list of original session numbers]

## Key Accomplishments

- Major feature or fix implemented
- Technical decisions made
- Problems solved

## Development Details

[Preserve based on age rules]

## Technical Context

[Important code snippets, patterns, decisions]

## Future Considerations

[Outstanding items, recommendations]
```

#### 2. Sequential Numbering

- Find highest session number
- Create new consolidated files with incremented numbers
- Add topic suffix: `session-XXX-frontend.md`

#### 3. Cleanup Protocol

```bash
# After successful consolidation
rm .claude/tasks/session-[old-numbers].md
```

### Quality Assurance

- Verify all session content is preserved in consolidated files
- Ensure topic categorization is accurate
- Confirm age-based detail preservation is applied correctly
- Validate consolidated file format and structure

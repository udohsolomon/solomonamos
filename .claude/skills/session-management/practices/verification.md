# Practice: Verification Before Completion

This practice applies to ALL session types. Use it before making any completion claim.

---

## Core Rule

**Evidence before claims, always.**

Never claim something is done, working, passing, or fixed without executing a verification command and showing the output.

---

## Verification Gate Protocol

Before ANY status claim (completed, passing, working, fixed):

### Step 1: Identify

What command proves this claim?

| Claim | Verification Command |
|-------|---------------------|
| "Tests pass" | `npm test` / `pytest` |
| "Build succeeds" | `npm run build` |
| "No lint errors" | `npm run lint` |
| "Server starts" | Start server, show output |
| "Bug is fixed" | Run reproducer, show it works |
| "Feature works" | Execute feature, show result |

### Step 2: Execute

Run the command NOW.

- Not from memory
- Not from previous run
- Fresh execution in current state

### Step 3: Read

Check the complete output:

- Exit code (0 = success)
- Full output text
- Any warnings or errors
- Counts (X tests passed, 0 failed)

### Step 4: Verify

Does the output actually confirm your claim?

- "All tests pass" requires seeing "X passed, 0 failed"
- "Build succeeds" requires exit code 0
- "No errors" requires clean output

### Step 5: Claim with Evidence

State your claim WITH output:

```markdown
All 47 tests pass:

```
npm test
> 47 passing (3.2s)
```
```

## Red Flag Phrases

**Never use these without evidence:**

| Red Flag | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| "should pass now" | Assumption, not verification |
| "probably works" | Hedging without proof |
| "seems to be working" | Vague, unverified |
| "I believe it's fixed" | Belief is not evidence |
| "looks correct" | Visual inspection insufficient |
| "I'm confident" | Confidence is not verification |

**If you catch yourself using these, STOP and run the verification command.**

---

## Stop Signals

Run verification immediately when you're about to:

- Mark a task complete
- Claim tests pass
- Say something is fixed
- Commit code
- Move to next task
- Express satisfaction ("Great!", "Done!")

---

## Correct vs Incorrect

### Incorrect (No Evidence)

```markdown
I've fixed the bug. The tests should pass now.
```

**Problem**: "should" is not evidence.

### Correct (With Evidence)

```markdown
Bug fixed. Verification:

```bash
npm test
PASS src/auth.test.ts
  - validates token correctly (3ms)
  - rejects expired tokens (2ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests: 2 passed, 2 total
```
```

## Integration with Session Types

### Development Sessions
- Verify after each task batch (3 tasks)
- Verify before marking session complete

### Debugging Sessions
- Verify reproducer before fix
- Verify fix resolves issue
- Verify no regressions

### Migration Sessions
- Verify feature parity
- Verify old behavior preserved
- Verify all tests pass

### TDD Sessions
- Verify RED (test fails)
- Verify GREEN (test passes)
- Verify no regressions

### Review Sessions
- Verify issues reported match code
- Verify suggested fixes work

## Quick Reference

```
Before claiming X:
1. What proves X? → [command]
2. Run [command] NOW
3. Read full output
4. Output confirms X?
5. State X + show output

No output = No claim
```
